# React for Reddit

A lightweight client for Reddit made in React.

See demo [here](https://psande.github.io/react-for-reddit/).

`State: IN PROGRESS`

## Frontend

- See [README](https://github.com/psande/react-for-reddit/tree/main/frontend) in the frontend folder.

## Backend
- For the time being the frontend runs using the reddit API directly. A set of microservices are being coded that will act as proxies to collect data and experiment with different DB's and server models.

## Planning
Visit the [Projects](https://github.com/psande/react-for-reddit/projects) and [Issues](https://github.com/psande/react-for-reddit/issues) tabs to see what is pending and progress on tasks.
